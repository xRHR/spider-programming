            <h2>How To Solve The 3x3 Rubik's Cube</h2>
            <p>This is a super simple Rubik's Cube tutorial, where you don't need to learn move notation or long algorithms.</p>
            <p>With some practice, you should be able to solve the cube in about 2-4 minutes. If you want to get even faster, you should learn How to do Finger Tricks and learn the CFOP Method.</p>

            <h2>Example Solve</h2>
            <p>You can also watch the beginner method example solve in case anything is unclear.</p>
            <p>If you have any further questions, you can go to the video and leave a comment, which I try my best to answer.</p>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>First layer cross</li>
                <li>First layer</li>
                <li>Second layer</li>
                <li>Edge orientation of the last layer (EOLL)</li>
                <li>Edge permutation of the last layer (EPLL)</li>
                <li>Corner permutation of the last layer (CPLL)</li>
                <li>Corner orientation of the last layer (COLL)</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Next Steps</h2>
            <p>Congrats on solving the Rubik's Cube! With practice, you should be able to do this in a few minutes, or even under 1 minute if you practice a lot. Some people stop there, which is totally fine. But if you want to get even faster, you should learn How to do Finger Tricks and learn the CFOP Method, which is most of the fastest cubers use.</p>
            <p>My advice is that you should not rush to learn new things until you're well practiced with what you know, otherwise it can feel overwhelming. CFOP does have many algorithms to memorize, but don't be pressured into thinking that learning more algorithms is what makes you faster in the end. Cubing is much more interesting because that is NOT the case, and there's much more to learn besides algorithms. Check out my sub-11 second average using a total of 16 algorithms, which is part of what you learn with beginner CFOP.</p>

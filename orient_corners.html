            <p>It is very easy to make a mistake during this step, so I recommend reading the whole thing, including the common mistakes, before attempting it.</p>
            <p>Turn the cube over so that the unsolved corners are all in the bottom layer.</p>
            <p>You may have 2, 3, or 4 unsolved corner pieces.</p>
            <p><img src="oc1.png" alt="2,3 or 4 corners are in correct positions but not oriented correctly"></p>
            <p>Repeatedly do the 4-move sequence until the front/right corner is solved (has yellow on the bottom).</p>
            <p>Then turn the bottom layer (not the whole cube) to bring an unsolved corner to the front/right. Repeat until the whole cube is solved.</p>
            <p><img src="oc2.png" alt="Do 4-moves until corner is oriented correctly, turn the bottom and repeat until all corners are solved"></p>
            <p>Common mistakes:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Turning the whole cube to get the next corner to the bottom/right. Make sure you turn only the bottom layer.</li>
                <li>Not finishing the 4-moves because the corner is solved after 3 moves. Make sure you always finish the 4-moves.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> If you only have 1 corner unsolved while the rest of the cube is solved, or if you followed step 7 correctly but it does not work, then your cube is unsolvable, and needs to be taken apart and reassembled.</p>
